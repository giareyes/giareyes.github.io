## Gillian Reyes
Hi, I'm Gia. I studied Math and Computer Science at Yale University for my undergraduate degree, and wrote my thesis on physics simulations in computer graphics. 

Currently, I am a Quantitative Strategist at Goldman Sachs. You can find my resume [here.](files/gillian_reyes_resume.pdf)

### Projects
#### A Tensor Algebraic Approach to Reduced-Order St. Venant-Kirchhoff Deformations
My thesis project mentioned above. In this project, I went through Barbic and James's 2005 Paper, "Real-time subspace integration for st. venant-kirchhoff deformable models", and implemented their reduced-order euler-lagrange equations of motion using tensor algebraic internal force and stiffness matrix polynomials, as opposed to the finite element method used in their paper. The benefit to this implementation is that it makes it extensible to other deformation methods, such as the Stable Neo-Hookean method. You can find the writeup for this project [here.](files/senior_thesis.pdf) You can also access the code for this project through [my github.](https://github.com/giareyes/deformable-objects)

#### Shadow Hunters 
For our software engineering class, my friends and I turned one of our favorite board games into an [online, multi-player game](https://shadowhunters.live/). I led the front-end development for our project, creating visuals using the Phaser JS Library. I also drew all the character art!

### Fun stuff
- I love running, broomball, and bouldering!
- In my free time, I like to draw and paint.
